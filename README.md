# **Clips Mental Health Evaluation Program**  
### **_Description:_** 
The goal of this project is to provide a rule-based Expert system that is capable of making mental health diagnosises, and providing potential treatment options for the user of the system.  Expert systems aim to provide the knowledge equivalent of an expert in the field.  This system works to diagnosis major mental health disorders such as Depression, Bipolar disorder, Eating disorders, and various others. These disorders are determined based on actual questionaires used in research settings and consultations of experts.  This program is built using CLIPS, a rule based forward chaining programming language that is written in C.  CLIPS is an expert system language that is open source and allows for knowledge to be represented in a system of rules.
